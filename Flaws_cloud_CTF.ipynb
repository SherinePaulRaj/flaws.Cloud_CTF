By manipulating various AWS services, such as S3 and Lambda, and exploiting credentials, several key security vulnerabilities were explored. This hands-on approach reinforces the importance of maintaining secure AWS configurations, effective credential management, and the need for constant vigilance against unauthorized access.\n",
